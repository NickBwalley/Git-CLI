git fetch -all
git reset --hard origin/master

EXPLANATION
git fetch downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.
Then the git reset resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The --hard option 
changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in origin/master
