"Hello There my name is Nick Bwalley"
I am an expert coder working with Java, C++ and Python 
My dream is becoming a game programmer and a system programmer 
I love coding and i do it not only for money but also for passion because I just love it 
So far the Easiest programming language that i have learned so far is python as
compared to Java and C++ which amongs't all C++ is the hardest but its the best programming language because of 
its very very fast running time complexity 

Thank you very  much and don't forget that very soon i will create a system which i will be remembered for 
the rest of my life.... Thank You!...
